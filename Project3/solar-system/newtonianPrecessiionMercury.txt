name the run: relativisticprecessionmercury
initial angular momentum [0, 0, -6.31174e-07]; and afterwards [0, 0, -6.31174e-07];
angular momentum is conserved! with a relative change of 2.31769e-07 over 100 years.
With relativistic gravity, there is a precession of -1.31397e-05 arcseconds in a century.
