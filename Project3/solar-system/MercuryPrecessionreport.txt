relativistic: initial angular momentum [0, 0, -6.31174e-07]; and afterwards [0, 0, -6.31174e-07];
angular momentum is conserved! with a relative change of 2.47598e-13 over 100 years.
With relativistic gravity, there is a precession of 42.762 arcseconds in a century.


Newtonian: initial angular momentum [0, 0, -6.31174e-07]; and afterwards [0, 0, -6.31174e-07];
angular momentum is conserved! with a relative change of 6.20002e-13 over 100 years.
With newtonian gravity, there is a precession of 0.0211294 arcseconds in a century.
