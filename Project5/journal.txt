thurs 6/12-18:
    first entry. anxious about project. Not finished with theoretical part, but will suspend
developement in favour of cranking out workable code. Ideal is to hammer out a minimum skeleton
today and look to parallellization tonight and tomorrow. Once able to set simulations to cook, will
work on updating theory.
    14:45: random header and store class mostly up and running. Next priority is to put up a system class containing
the necessary wave functions as well as the hamiltonian/energy for a given state. After that, comes the MC sweep and cycle
class. Parallellization would be considered after this.
